Simple to-do list created with React, Material UI and Redux.
Things to improve:
1) Data isn't stored anywhere.
2) Color scheme is ugly. 
3) Layout should change according to screen size. 
4) Clean up code. Put Material UI styles in separate files, delete redundant css files.
5) Add comments to code.
